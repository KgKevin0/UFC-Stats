# UFC Stats

## Project Overview

UFC Stats is a data-driven project aimed at providing comprehensive datasets and insights about UFC fighters and events. Utilizing web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup, this project has successfully scraped data from over 4,100+ fighter pages and 650+ event pages on UFCstats.com. The result is two extensive datasets: `UFC_fighters.csv` and `UFC_events.csv`, detailing individual fighter statistics and event information.

## Datasets

### UFC_fighters.csv
- **Description**: Contains individual stats for all scraped fighters.
- **Size**: Over 4,100+ rows | 21 columns.
- **Data**: Includes a variety of statistics such as fighter records, physical attributes, and performance metrics.

### UFC_events.csv
- **Description**: Contains data for all scraped UFC events.
- **Size**: Over 650+ rows | 4 columns.
- **Data**: Includes information such as event dates, locations, and participating fighters.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Utilized `Beautiful Soup` to scrape data from UFCstats.com, navigating through fighter profiles and event pages.
- **Dataset Creation**: Compiled extensive datasets from the scraped data, resulting in detailed and comprehensive records.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough analysis and visualization of the datasets to derive insights and understand trends.

## Technical Skills and Learning

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The project is implemented in Python, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation and analysis.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Used for web scraping, showcasing skills in extracting and cleaning data from web pages.
- **Pandas**: Employed for dataset creation and manipulation, ensuring efficient data handling and analysis.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Utilized for EDA, enhancing the presentation and interpretation of data.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Web Scraping**: Gained proficiency in web scraping, learning to navigate and manipulate `HTML` and `CSS` structures.
- **Data Handling**: Developed skills in creating, cleaning, and manipulating datasets.
- **Data Analysis**: Enhanced understanding of exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.
- **Time Management**: Completed the project under a three-day time constraint, showcasing efficient project management and prioritization skills.

## Future Improvements
